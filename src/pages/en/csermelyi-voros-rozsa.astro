            Physical activity has been an integral part of my life since childhood. Besides my competitive dance
            background, I enjoyed trying other forms of movement as well. This is how I ended up at my first yoga class
            during high school. I was pleased to discover that practicing could ease my occasionally emerging anxiety.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            I first heard about Ashtanga yoga in Bertalan Sugár's classes. It made me very curious, but I procrastinated
            for a year before attending my first Mysore class. I was afraid and didn't believe in myself; I didn't think
            I was capable of maintaining such an intensive and regular practice.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            However, as I was going through a difficult period and longed for change, I finally came to Bandha Works on
            a cold February morning. I clearly remember my first impressions. I watched the practitioners, listened to
            the Ujjayi breathing, and knew right then that this was what I had been looking for.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            I was quickly caught up in it, practicing regularly, and after 3 years I felt that I needed to go to Mysore,
            to the source. In 2022, I was accepted to the Sharath Yoga Centre. I feel very fortunate to have had the
            opportunity to practice for 2 months under the supervision of Paramaguru Sharath Jois. Additionally, it was
            profound to gain insight into South Indian culture and be part of people's everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            I am extremely grateful to my teachers and to the practice. I have learned a lot about humility, faith,
            acceptance, and overcoming my fears. I am curious to see what the practice will teach me and where it will
            take me next.
