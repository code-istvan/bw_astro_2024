        <p>
            The Sanskrit word <b>ashtanga</b> means eight limbs, referring to Patanjali's eight-limbed yoga system. Patanjali
            Maharishi was supposedly a great Indian sage who lived in the 2nd century BCE and wrote the Yoga Sutras. In these
            concise aphorisms, he proposed an eight-step method for yoga practitioners, hence the name ashtanga (eight limbs)
            yoga.

            Based on this, asana is just a small slice of the whole, yet it plays an extremely important role in

        <p class="mt-20px">
            The vinyasa system means the strict harmony between movement and breath. Its essence is that we perform
            specific movements with each inhalation and exhalation, and we hold the asanas for five or more breaths.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            The heart of the system is the so-called
            <a href="/blog/astanga-triszthana/" class="link-enhanced link-orange">tristhana</a>
            - the three points of focus - which are <b>asana</b>, <b>loud breathing</b>, and
            <b>drishti</b>. The sound of breathing is like the roaring of ocean waves, and concentrating on it is a
            pratyahara technique that helps turn our attention inward. The <b>drishti,</b> the focusing of the gaze, when
            performed correctly, allows us to practice the sequences with a calm and clear mind.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            The asanas are made light, stable, and safe by the <b>bandhas</b>. The <b>bandhas</b> are muscle locks on the
            physical level, while within the subtle body they control the regulation of <b>prana</b> (life force). In the
            ashtanga vinyasa system, we practice fixed asana sequences, six in total, each person practicing the one(s) suitable
            for them, which we perform unchanged six times a week.

        <p class="mb-20px mt-20px">
            The asanas in the series build upon each other, therefore in traditional practice with a qualified teacher,
            we continue until we reach a posture that we cannot execute. In technical terms, this is called our 'last
            asana,' which we can repeat multiple times to improve in it. With this method, practitioners of any ability
            can benefit from the system's positive effects, and last but not least, injuries can be avoided.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            This is possible to implement in so-called Mysore-style classes, where, unlike in led classes, everyone
            practices according to their own breathing rhythm, and the teacher has the opportunity to provide assistance
            based on each person's individual condition.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            <b>Saturdays</b> and <b>full moon and new moon days</b> (
            <a href="/en/holdnapok" class="link-enhanced link-orange">moon days</a>
            ), as well as the first three days of menstruation for women - <b>ladies' days</b> - are traditionally rest days.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            Traditionally we practice the asanas in the morning, ideally before sunrise, so that the beneficial effects
            of the practice influence our entire day. At first this might be difficult for a beginner practitioner, but
            over time it becomes habitual and naturally integrates into everyday life.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            In a traditional ashtanga school's schedule, there are two types of classes: the aforementioned <b>
                Mysore
            </b> and the <b>led class</b>. The primary purpose of the led class is to precisely learn the sequence of
            asanas and the connecting movements – vinyasa – between individual asanas, as well as to develop proper
            rhythm in practice.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-20px">
            These class types are complemented by a monthly ashtanga conference, where program participants can ask
            their questions, and there is time and space to discuss the theory of ashtanga yoga.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-40px font-family-primary clr-brand-orange h3-like">
            Overall, Ashtanga yoga offers a purposeful, step-by-step system for those who strive toward achieving unity
            of body, mind, and soul.

        <h3 class="clr-brand-orange font-family-primary mb-20px">
            Vinyasa krama yoga is an ancient path of physical and spiritual self-development that unites learning,
            practice, and teaching. The system has a unique approach to yogasana (yoga postures). It synchronizes the
            functions of body, mind, and breath over time, allowing the practitioner to experience the true joy of asana
            practice.
        </h3>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            The Sanskrit prefix <span class="italic">"vi"</span> in vinyasa means <span class="italic">
                "variation"
            </span>, while the suffix <span class="italic">"nyasa"</span> means <span class="italic">
                "under prescribed conditions"
            </span>, thus the complete compound word vinyasa refers to the harmony between movement and breath, and the
            word
            <span class="italic">"krama"</span> means methodology.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            The characteristic of this style is that each movement must be executed with proper vinyasa, meaning the
            asanas are connected by breath-synchronized linking elements. The mind also closely follows the slow,
            steady, and audible yoga breathing; thereby achieving the true purpose of yoga: the subjugation of body and
            mind. Perhaps the most well-known example is the six series of Ashtanga vinyasa yoga, which also belong to
            the vinyasa krama system.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            Vinyasa krama closely follows the classical definition of yoga. Yoga is generally defined in two ways: as
            union (yukti) or inner peace (samadhi). Using breath as a yoke, vinyasa krama yoga synchronizes body and
            mind, thus creating union. Additionally, as the mind follows the deep and steady breath, with persistent
            practice, the highest level of peace (samadhi) can eventually be achieved.

                Sri. T. Krishnamacharya
            </a>
            brought this type of yoga back into public consciousness. In the 1930s, he wrote Yoga Makaranda (The Nectar of
            Yoga), in which he presents the vinyasa krama system. Of the hundreds of existing vinyasa sequences, he describes
            only a few, but we shouldn't think that the term refers only to these specific sequences. In his book, the master
            mentions that he learned about 700 asanas from his teacher, which suggests that Yoga Makaranda is just a small
            taste of the complete system.

        <h3 class="font-family-primary clr-brand-orange mt-20px mb-20px">Spiritual Background</h3>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            According to Krishnamacharya, the three main aspects of vinyasa krama are <b>vinyasa chikitsa</b>,
            <b>vinyasa shakti</b>, and <b>vinyasa adhyatmika</b>. Vinyasa chikitsa is the therapeutic approach to yoga,
            vinyasa shakti increases strength, and vinyasa adhyatmika brings the practitioner closer initially to the
            subtle physical elements, and later to God. The latter method is not so much a specific technique, but
            rather an approach to practice. Thus, while practicing the first two techniques, we begin to show devotion
            to our highest self. This is also called bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion. This is never passive
            submission, but rather a positive attitude toward all individual souls, recognizing the divine spark in
            everything and everyone.

        <p class="mt-20px">
            According to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, the conditions for the realization of yogasanas are as follows:

                    <p>
                        For a posture to be called a yogasana, it must enable its practitioner to remain stable, whether
                        it's a simple standing position or a headstand.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We focus the mind on the breath, ensuring that we remain in an extremely joyful and relaxed
                        state during practice.

                </div>

            <div>
                <h3 class="font-family-primary mb-20px">Steady and Slow Breathing (prayatna shaithilya)</h3>
                <p>
                    This method is recommended by Patanjali to facilitate practice. Here, prayatna (effort, striving)
                    refers to jivana prayatna (will to live), which is nothing other than breathing itself. This
                    condition stipulates that breathing must remain steady and slow during practice. Therefore, when
                    practicing yoga correctly, we should not be heavily panting. Unlike aerobic sports (which also have
                    their benefits), neither breathing rate nor pulse rate should increase. The normal breathing rate is
                    15-20 breaths per minute. Since movements are slow in vinyasa yoga, the breathing rate should also
                    be reduced. Ideally, we breathe no more than five or six times per minute.

        <h3 class="font-family-primary clr-brand-orange mt-20px mb-20px">Pulse Rate in Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            During vinyasa yoga practice, we must perform audible breathing, as this automatically regulates the breath.
            If during the numerous vinyasas of the sequence, the practitioner feels overexerted and finds it difficult
            to breathe, they should take a few minutes' rest until their breathing returns to normal. Practitioners in
            the vinyasa system often notice that over time, their breathing slows down in everyday life as well, making
            their minds calmer and more serene. There are yogis who can maintain four breaths per minute throughout
            their hour-long practice. For them, even the most challenging poses are deeply relaxing.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-family-primary clr-brand-orange mt-20px mb-20px">Focusing the Mind on the Breath</h3>
        <p class="mt-20px">
            We must focus our mind on the breath during vinyasa practice. If our mind wanders, we should gently bring it
            back to the breath. Fortunately, most people find it easy to pay attention to the breath, thus enjoying the
            practice
        </p>
        <p class="mt-20px font-family-primary clr-brand-orange h3-like">
            Krishnamacharya always applied the principles of vinyasa krama during asana teaching, never teaching
            isolated asanas without vinyasa and breath. This is the key to teaching vinyasa krama: maintaining slow,
            steady breathing, and knowledge of a wide range of asanas.
