###     How did you get introduced to Ashtanga yoga?  
When I was in dire need of healing my injured shoulder and wanted to delve deeply into the study of yoga, I researched the word “Āshtanga,” which I had heard many times  while working with a Yoga and Ayurveda company and also at the Rishikesh yoga festival earlier.  Through my research, I discovered that āshtanga, a practice that caught my attention for its discipline and sincerity, could also serve as a source for using asana methods to heal my shoulder.

### The Yoga Sutras don't mention that we should seek out a Guru and learn the science of yoga from them. In your opinion, what is the significance of Guru parampara in our modern age today, where yoga can be learned from numerous sources?  
When we look back on history, Patanjali himself had students to whom he taught and passed on his knowledge. This has been a common tradition in India, where a student learns from a teacher and later teaches their own students, continuing the cycle. With so much information available today, it's easy to become confused and lost in the clouds of ignorance. A true Guru or lineage acts as a compass, ensuring the teachings remain aligned with the original purpose without losing their essence. Many sincere seekers may not have easy access to a living Guru in these modern times. In such cases, deep devotion to authentic teachings, humility, and surrender to the divine can invoke inner guidance

### How did you find Paramagu Sharath Jois, and what was your first Mysore season like with him?

Through my initial research on Ashtanga yoga, I learned about Sharath Guruji. Ever since then, I have always wanted to practice under him. Interestingly, even without meeting him, I already felt a voice inside me and a resonance in my heart telling me that he no is my guru. During my first season with him, I felt a strong connection through his presence, guidance, and gentle strictness. I had no expectations from him; I just wanted to dedicate myself completely to the practice and my journey with him. It made me feel complete knowing that I had found my guru.

### Have you experienced any advantages in practicing Ashtanga yoga from being raised in a Brahmin family and becoming familiar with the yamas and niyamas from childhood? And speaking of this, in your opinion, how important is it to adhere to the sequence of the eight limbs, or can the practice be effective if followed in a different order?  

Yes, absolutely. I’m fortunate enough to have learned Yama and Niyamas through my parents. In fact, in many Indian households, moral ethics have always been a part of the culture from an early age—the do's and don'ts. These teachings come from the Bhagavad Gita and other texts. The paths may differ, but the destination is the same. Likewise, in some traditions, they start with Yama and Niyamas and then can jump directly to Dhyana, where they might not emphasize Pranayama or Asana as much. However, there is always a fundamental touch of all the limbs that leads to the same destination. In the Ashtanga tradition, Sharath Guruji always says that Asana is not the main focus; Yama and Niyamas are. So, Yama and Niyamas are the foundation, checklist, and parameters to the destination, which is the higher self, or state of bliss. Without them, there is impurity in the mind, which is not conducive to practice (stillness). The sequence is very important to me, and it’s been intellectually crafted for the betterment of humanity. Just as we cannot move to the next Asana without finding grace and comfort in the present one, we cannot progress to another limb or skip it without experiencing and practicing the step-by-step method in the eight limbs as taught by the creators.

### What are the misconceptions that you often encounter regarding Ashtanga yoga among Western practitioners?

These common misconceptions are for all practitioners like - it being too rigid, only for young and fit people, solely physical, injury-prone, very hard style of yoga, for weight loss and demanding daily practice without rest.

### Along with your intensive practice of Ashtanga yoga, you are also deeply involved with the ancient science of Ayurveda. How did these two traditions become interconnected for you? What benefits have you experienced from integrating Ayurvedic principles into your daily life and practice as an Ashtanga practitioner? In what ways do these systems help deepen each other?

I first encountered Ayurveda when I started working for an Ayurveda health resort, where I have been promoting Ayurveda and yoga tourism for India, promoting Ayurveda's health benefits through the company. I studied MBA marketing, and I have been promoting Ayurveda and yoga for wellness brands since then. And I loved it. I became curious about seeing the results of case studies on Ayurveda treatments and lifestyle. After some years, I began to get more involved by learning a little more and pursuing some studies. Ayurveda teaches us how to maintain a balanced lifestyle by taking care of ourselves and understanding our needs. It emphasizes what should and should not be in our body and mind. Having a proper digestive system, balanced meals, oil baths, etc., are all crucial parts of practice. Any imbalance in these areas will be reflected in our practice, indicating the need for healing and curing. And hence this helps me to understand my body well, less fatigue, knowing how to heal during crisis, what’s good for my practice and what’s not. Ayurveda and yoga are sister sciences. Ayurveda helps cultivate a better body and mind, while yoga aids in transcending towards our final goal, which is spiritual awareness.

### I’ve heard that mantra chanting plays a significant role in your spiritual journey. What transformative effects have you experienced from the regular practice of mantras in your own life and inner development? How do you incorporate this ancient sound practice tradition into your teaching, and what changes have you observed in students who have followed this practice?

To fully experience the benefits of mantra chanting, one must engage in the practice with an open heart, free from bias and prejudice. My experience with chanting is that it creates a divine connection to the Lord and something higher. It calms my mind with its vibrations, especially when done with intention and feeling. Chanting is mentioned in the scriptures as an integral part of the sound. Having grown up with these practices, I find that they create an energetic atmosphere both during and after chanting. I encourage students to participate in chanting at least a few days a week. I don’t force anyone; those who have the will come on their own. Whoever participates and devotes time to it eventually loves it and can feel its essence. I feel immense joy when students after chanting asks if I can teach it to them online when they are away. It shows their interests and a shift of the connection that they felt while doing it. Chanting is love, Bhakti. Without Bhakti, there is no yoga or spiritual practice.

### Based on what you've shared so far, your daily sādhanā seems to be a profound and time-intensive process. How does a typical day unfold for you when you're not traveling to teach? What daily routine do you follow, and besides āsanas, what other yoga techniques (pranayama, meditation, etc.) form an integral part of your everyday practice?

My day begins with my personal practice, preceded by necessary fundamentals like cleansing my body. After my practice, I teach either at the Shala or online. I don’t consume anything in the morning; I have my breakfast only after my class, or sometimes, I drink herbal tea or water while teaching. The day continues with some sun bathing, preparing breakfast, after which I return to my other work, which includes household chores, wellness marketing tasks, or sometimes a second breakfast, preparing lunch/dinner. Whenever I get an opportunity I would like to spend little time in nature. I wake up early, like many others, and tend to sleep early, so my day typically ends at around 8 PM. In between tasks, I listen to music, and on weekends, I meet with friends and family. Besides asanas, I engage in japa meditation, chanting, simple pranayama, and other pranayama exercises as part of my practice and studying some texts.

### What is the biggest internal transformation you have experienced within yourself during your Ashtanga yoga practice?

Ability to understand the mind body coordination and heal the body with the laws of nature. Being more mindful with my actions. Resilience, Patience, Love and acceptance. These are some of the takeaway lessons for me.

### Finally, the yoga community was deeply affected by Sharath Guruji's unexpected passing. How did you personally experience this significant loss? What changes has this sad event brought to your own practice and your insights about the path of Ashtanga yoga? Based on his teachings and guidance, how do you see the future of Ashtanga yoga - in your personal journey, how do you build upon the knowledge he imparted, and do you feel it necessary to seek the guidance of a new Guru?

Well, like many others, it has affected me very deeply; never have I ever felt something like this in my life before. The loss of our guru and the profound impact that was created during the days of his passing were difficult to process and, most importantly, to believe. 
However, I felt much lighter after his funeral. During the initial days of practice, it was difficult, but slowly I got used to it. Certain thoughts kept echoing within me, but gradually, things became clearer day by day, and I felt his presence was always there with my practice. 

If we truly love āshtanga yoga and respect the traditions and our guru, the future of āshtanga yoga will always be secure. If we get trapped in envy, anger, ego, etc., it will never be safe for individuals. However, the practice will always endure, and the tradition will remain alive, no matter what one thinks, just like all the other traditions that continue without the physical presence of a guru after their passing. 
It is up to the disciples and students to preserve it. It’s our dharma. 

I will continue practicing alone, and whenever I have access to some teachers to learn from, I will always step forward to learn, whether in Mysore or anywhere accessible. In my opinion, Guruji’s teachings were straightforward: you build up your physical ability to withstand the storm, practice the yamas and niyamas, and cultivate ethical values for the spiritual journey. \

I believe a guru comes when needed, whether in physical or astral form. We don’t need a physical guru at all times for the rest of our lives if one is not present. A guru's teachings can be learned and practiced without their presence. If we constantly seek the presence of a guru, it becomes an attachment once again. The practice is to learn detachment. Then we are free.

### Thank you very much for your time and for sharing these experiences, insights, and wisdom with us. Your perspectives have been truly valuable.
