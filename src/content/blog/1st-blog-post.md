Samuel focuses on documenting the ever-changing society and highlighting the different aspects of the human experience.
His work has won awards at international festivals and competitions and is featured in numerous photography magazines
and articles.

Due to his keen interest in street photography, Samuel became a GRist and Ricoh GR Ambassador in 2013. His work is
inspired by the work of well-known photographers such as Daido Moriyama, Matt Stuart and Alex Webb.

He shares his passion for street photography through his YouTube channel Samuel Streetlife.

With his videos, he covers a wide range of photography. Even though street photography is a main focus, the channel is a
valuable source of information for the subscribers of his channel. Here, he introduces well-known and also less
well-known photographers, reports on photography and technology, and his contributions, which are also quite critical,
on the current developments around the Ricoh GR have long since made him a sought-after advisor around this system.

And so the diversity of his contributions is one of the reasons for the emergence of a dedicated online community.

In addition to his photo projects, Samuel also gives photography workshops, both offline and online. Samuel currently
lives in Hamburg, but often travels to Osaka, his second home. But no matter where he is, he never travels without his
trusty GR III and GR IIIx cameras.

He answers the question why he has been a friend of the Ricoh GR for several generations in many of his videos. But one
of the main reasons we see documented in the images Lintaro shares with us here. All the pictures are unplanned and were
taken because he was in the right place at the right time, and then had a camera with all the finesse of a real photo
camera in his pocket to realise even challenging motifs - in the spirit of the old Japanese tradition of snap shot
photography.
